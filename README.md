## ⚙️ How It Works

1.  **AI Integration**: The bot listens for mentions and uses Groq's LLM to generate responses based on a custom "Mafia" system prompt.
2.  **Graphical Generation**: Uses `canvas` to dynamically draw game registration cards and status updates.
3.  **Data Storage**: All data (Cards, Inventory, Economy) is stored locally in JSON files for persistence and speed.
